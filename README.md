# Developer Relations Foundation Governance

Developer Relations Foundation is a community-driven project, with no funding involved. This repo was created  with the aim of helping community participants better understand how DevRel Foundation operates. 

At this point, part of the community calls are being used as Open Office Hours to reach community consensus on the foundation's next steps and governance process. People can access the APAC, EMEA, and AMER calls to get involved [here](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation#community-calls).

There is also a brief [survey](https://discord.com/channels/1255563562449899573/1255564574380261426/1273351313001943172) that allows people to:

- Express interest in getting more involved in the Foundation formation and how
- Review and give feedback on the [FAQs]((https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation#faq)) and [challenges](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/challenges.md)
- Express preferences for how and when the Foundation may communicate with you

    <strong>ðŸ§­ Volunteer Steering Committee Member Responsibilities </strong>
  </summary><br />
The Volunteer Steering Committee is comprised of the initial group of individuals, all tenured Developer Relations and Developer Marketing leaders, who connected over the shared vision of creating a foundation.

The primary responsibilities of the Volunteer Steering Committee are:

- Established the initial charter and governance model that contributed to the LF's "intent to form" commitment
- Collect input on priorities and interest in getting involved to move forward on processes, policies, and frameworks that will be driven by working groups, as well as forming the initial working groups
- Internal project management and operations, including PR, community, website development, and communications

Out of the working groups, we anticipate recommendations on governance that will include how to elect Foundation leadership moving forward. At that time, any leadership roles we play (if at all) will be determined through the established election processes.

## Our Playbook - Operational Guidelines

The DRF Playbook serves as a hands-on resource for the community. While the Charter provides a general overview of the projectâ€™s structure and governance, the Playbook covers specific operational details that ensure smooth participation and collaboration. It includes guidelines on how community participants can submit new proposals, where and how these proposals are discussed via community calls, and the community calls roles and responsibilities.

### DRF Community Calls

This group hosts community calls every other week. People can check the times and upcoming calls in the Groups.io calendar: https://lists.dev-rel.org/g/community/calendar

- AMER DevRel Found Community Call
- APAC & EMEA DevRel Found Community Call

These calls serve two main purposes:

1. A neutral and safe space to discuss topics important to the community, share ideas, and ask questions aligned with the mission of the DevRel Foundation. If you have a story to share, the recommended process is to open a new issue via GitHub Discussions (more info below) with the topic in mind. This allows the call moderators to bring these topics into sessions, initiate community discussions, and reach a consensus, potentially leading to a concrete action item (e.g., should this become a working group or be included in the foundation, etc.).
2. Open Office Hours to reach community consensus on the foundation's next phases and to address questions and blockers on DevRel Challenges and Frequently Asked Questions.

    <strong> ðŸ“š How to File Proposals and Discussion Topics </strong>
  </summary>

The community can file proposals via the DRF Governance repo by [opening a new entry in the GitHub Discussions Forum](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/discussions/new/choose).

Also, whether you are new to the DRF community calls or a regular participant, you can add your discussion topics as a comment in one of the [meeting note discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/discussions/categories/meeting-notes) or bring them up during the call.

People can also share DevRel use cases, best practices, frameworks, and more by [opening a new Idea in GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/devrel-foundation/governance/discussions/new?category=ideas), which serves as the Foundationâ€™s public forum. 

We are always looking for 5-10 minute presentations in future community calls to spark discussion with attendees and asynchronously.
