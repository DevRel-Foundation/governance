# Developer Relations Foundation Governance

Home of the Foundation Governance. Developer Relations Foundation is a community-driven project, with no funding involved.

At this point, part of the community calls are being used as Open Office Hours to reach community consensus on the foundation's next steps and governance process. People can access the APAC, EMEA, and AMER calls to get involved [here](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation#community-calls).

There is also a brief [survey](https://discord.com/channels/1255563562449899573/1255564574380261426/1273351313001943172) that allows people to:

- Express interest in getting more involved in the Foundation formation and how
- Review and give feedback on the [FAQs]((https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation#faq)) and [challenges](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/challenges.md)
- Express preferences for how and when the Foundation may communicate with you


## ðŸ§­ About Developer Relations Foundation Steering Committee 

The Steering Committee provides oversight for the entire open collaborative project as defined in the Developer Relations Foundation [Charter (first version, living document)](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/Technical_Charter_v1.0.adoc). Currently, a group of volunteers has helped establish initial lightweight processes to support community-driven initiatives. These initiatives, still to be defined, aim to shape the day-to-day work within the Foundation. Leadership roles inside these initiatives may be responsible for coordinating these daily activities and may also have the responsibility to appoint other roles. These leadership roles, as well as how these initiatives may be grouped and formed, are yet to be defined by the community.
