# Developer Relations Foundation Governance Playbook

Developer Relations Foundation is a community-driven project, with no funding involved. This README documents the official DRF Playbook to understand how the Developer Relations Foundation operates and is structured. While the general Charter provides a general overview of the project‚Äôs structure and governance, this document covers specific operational details that ensure smooth participation and collaboration. It includes documentation on the DRF community structure, roles, and responsibilities, communication channels, regular meetings, and processes to submit new proposals and start or continue discussions.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Terminology

This [Developer Relations Foundation Glossary](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/tree/main/glossary) establishes a common understanding of terms and roles used within the Developer Relations Foundation

## üéØ Introduction to DRF Phased Approach for Continuous Progress

DRF follows an iterable approach to organizing and managing the many community-driven initiatives important to the DevRel Profession. This process is designed to ensure that the DevRel Foundation isn‚Äôt led by the assumptions of the steering committee as to what the important topics to tackle are but instead charged with the stewardship of collecting input, creating processes to organize that data, and shepherding solutions to real problems. Phased Plan Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/drf_phases_plan.md)

Milestones achieved to date and text steps can be found in the [Working Group Cohort Project Board]()
## üå≥ Community Structure 

The work within the DRF Community happens across a variety of different groups with a Steering Committee to oversee DRF operations, but day-to-day work happens in our Working Groups

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Steering Committee
<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>üß≠ Steering Committee Overview</strong>
  </summary><br />
  The Steering Committee (SC) will consist of seven (7) voting members: Five (5) Elected seats chosen by the Developer Relations Foundation (DRF) Participants; and Two (2) Appointed seats chosen by the sitting SC to maintain diversity of region, gender, and industry.
  
In even-numbered years, we will elect two (2) elected seats and appoint one (1) seat.

In odd-numbered years, we will elect three (3) elected seats and appoint one (1) seat.

    <strong>üß≠ Steering Committee Responsibilities</strong>
  </summary><br />
The Steering Committee is comprised of the initial group of individuals, all tenured Developer Relations and Developer Marketing leaders, who connected over the shared vision of creating a foundation.

To date, their primary Developer Relations Foundation (DRF) Steering Committee (SC)  responsibilities include:

- Collecting input on priorities and encouraging community involvement to advance processes and frameworks. This includes forming and overseeing working groups to address specific areas of interest
- Leading and facilitating community calls across various time zones (AMER, EMEA, and APAC) to foster open discussions, share updates, and gather feedback from community and working group participants
- Overseeing project management and operational tasks such as public relations, website development, repo documentation and communications

The Developer Relations Foundation (DRF) Steering Committee achieved milestones are:

- Established the initial charter and governance model that contributed to the LF's "intent to form" commitment
- Collect input on priorities and interest in getting involved to move forward on processes, policies, and frameworks that will be driven by working groups, as well as forming the initial working groups
- Initiated internal project management and operations, including PR, community, website development, and communications

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Working Group Structure

Working groups were created to address the different challenges that this community put together and discussed during the 2024 community calls and open survey. Each WG operates independently and is bound by its own charter, which specifies the role election process, 
communication channels, rotations, and more. However, all WGs should have at least these two following roles: Managers (Project and Community management roles) and Participants.

## Community Calls and WG Meetings

If Time zones permit, people engaging in DRF community are expected to participate in the DRF Community Calls and any other meetings relevant to their working group. This group hosts community calls every other week. People can check the times and upcoming calls in the Groups.io calendar: https://lists.dev-rel.org/g/community/calendar

    <strong> üìö About Community Calls </strong>
  </summary>

This group hosts community calls every other week. People can check the times and upcoming calls in the Groups.io calendar: https://lists.dev-rel.org/g/community/calendar

- AMER & EMEA DevRel Found Community Call
- APAC & EMEA DevRel Found Community Call

These calls serve two main purposes:

1. A neutral and safe space to discuss topics important to the community, share ideas, and ask questions aligned with the mission of the DevRel Foundation. If you have a story to share, the recommended process is to open a new issue via GitHub Discussions (more info below) with the topic in mind. This allows the call moderators to bring these topics into sessions, initiate community discussions, and reach a consensus, potentially leading to a concrete action item (e.g., should this become a working group or be included in the foundation, etc.).
2. Open Office Hours to reach community consensus on the foundation's next phases and to address questions and blockers on DevRel Challenges and Frequently Asked Questions.

## Processes

Operational guidelines on how community participants can submit new proposals, where and how these proposals are discussed via community calls, and the community calls roles and responsibilities.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong> üìö How to File Proposals and Discussion Topics </strong>
  </summary>

The community can file proposals via the DRF Governance repo by [opening a new entry in the GitHub Discussions Forum](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/discussions/new/choose).

Also, whether you are new to the DRF community calls or a regular participant, you can add your discussion topics as a comment in one of the [meeting note discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/discussions/categories/meeting-notes) or bring them up during the call.

People can also share DevRel use cases, best practices, frameworks, and more by [opening a new Idea in GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/devrel-foundation/governance/discussions/new?category=ideas), which serves as the Foundation‚Äôs public forum. 

We are always looking for 5-10 minute presentations in future community calls to spark discussion with attendees and asynchronously.
