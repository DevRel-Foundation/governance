# Developer Relations Foundation Governance

Developer Relations Foundation is a community-driven project, with no funding involved. This repo was created  with the aim of helping community participants better understand how DevRel Foundation operates. 

At this point, part of the community calls are being used as Open Office Hours to reach community consensus on the foundation's next steps and governance process. People can access the APAC, EMEA, and AMER calls to get involved [here](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation#community-calls).

There is also a brief [survey](https://discord.com/channels/1255563562449899573/1255564574380261426/1273351313001943172) that allows people to:

- Express interest in getting more involved in the Foundation formation and how
- Review and give feedback on the [FAQs]((https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation#faq)) and [challenges](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/challenges.md)
- Express preferences for how and when the Foundation may communicate with you

    <strong>ðŸ§­ Volunteer Steering Committee Member Responsibilities </strong>
  </summary><br />
The Volunteer Steering Committee is comprised of the initial group of individuals, all tenured Developer Relations and Developer Marketing leaders, who connected over the shared vision of creating a foundation.

The primary responsibilities of the Volunteer Steering Committee are:

- Established the initial charter and governance model that contributed to the LF's "intent to form" commitment
- Collect input on priorities and interest in getting involved to move forward on processes, policies, and frameworks that will be driven by working groups, as well as forming the initial working groups
- Internal project management and operations, including PR, community, website development, and communications

Out of the working groups, we anticipate recommendations on governance that will include how to elect Foundation leadership moving forward. At that time, any leadership roles we play (if at all) will be determined through the established election processes.
