# Developer Relations Foundation Glossary

This glossary establishes a common understanding of terms and roles used within the Developer Relations Foundation:


- Committer: Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other artifacts in the DRF project’s repository in GitHub

- Contributor: Contributors include anyone in the community who contributes code, documentation, or other artifacts to DRF project’s repository in the shape of a Pull Request (PR).
A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.

- Community Calls: open weekly meetings for participants to provide progress updates on working group activities and non-working group activities. Topics and themes for each call are selected on a first-come, first-served basis.

- Discord: The platform that the Developer Relations Foundation uses for real-time chat discussions within the community.

- GitHub: The platform that the Developer Relations Foundation uses to organize and manage their collaborative project and its resources in a transparent and open way.
Is the shared workspace where participants can contribute to documents, designs, or other resources. Everyone can track changes, suggest improvements, and provide feedback,
ensuring the community can work together openly while staying aligned.

- Groups.io: The mailing list system that the Developer Relations Foundation uses to manage email-based communication within the community. It acts as a central hub for sharing updates, documenting DRF wiki, viewing the DRF meeting calendars, and facilitating discussions across working groups and the broader community. Groups.io is integrated with LFX, allowing seamless management of the platform, scheduling meetings specific for each working group, community calls and assigning moderator roles to manage meeting settings. This setup empowers each group to self-organize and host calls independently and decentralized, without requiring LF staff members to participate in every session.

- Groups.io Wiki: A set of pages within Groups.io used by the Developer Relations Foundation to store and organize key information about its working groups, progress, processes, and community activities.

- LFX Project Control Center: Platform used by Linux Foundation to simplify and centralize the management of tools and operations for open collaborative projects under its umbrella, including the Developer Relations Foundation (DRF). The platform enables LF project managers and DRF community managers to efficiently schedule virtual meetings and manage mailing lists in a standardized, secure environment. For more information visit the [official documentation](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center).

- Main Charter: The high-level living document that outlines the purpose and structure, of the foundation.

- Manager’s Coffee Chats: Informal 15-minute zoom calls for managers assigned to working groups to connect with peers. These sessions provide a space for peer support and addressing questions in a
casual setting. Participation is optional, and while Steering Committee members or LF staff may occasionally join, their presence is not mandatory. Anyone in the coffee chat can take the initiative to moderate the discussion if needed. There are two coffee chats per week, scheduled in two different time zones to accommodate global participants. 
The cadence and times are flexible and can be adjusted based on participant requests. Everyone who is in the dev-rel.org managers groups up mailing list receives an invitation by meetings@lfx.dev

- Governance: A set of processes that guide operations within the foundation. Processes

- Observers: Individuals interested in the foundation’s activities but with minimal engagement in its working groups.  What minimal engagement means is to be determined by each working group.

- Pull Request: A pull request is a way to suggest changes to the DRF collaborative project, whether it’s related to content, design, or code. Instead of editing the original document or artifact directly, you make a copy, improve it, and then ask the group to review your changes. A pull request lets everyone see what you’ve changed, give feedback, and decide if the updates should be added to the original in an open way asking for permission to merge your edits into the main work.

- Working Group: A focused team under DRF formed to tackle particular issues that require specialized attention.

Working groups are ad hoc, and they will be codified in the charter once they complete their charters.

- Working Group Manager: A role under a working group responsible for the moderation and community management of the WG.
