. **Mission and Scope of the Project** 
.. The mission of the Project is to elevate the professional practice of developer relations and increase awareness of it as a driver of business value. 
.. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including definitions, frameworks, and the creation and codification of other artifacts that aid in the mission of the open collaboration project. 
. **Definitions**
.. Participant: A Developer Relations Foundation Participant (“Participant”) is any individual who has formally registered with the Foundation, subscribes to its communications, and actively participates in its initiatives, working groups, events, or community activities. DRF Participants are eligible to vote in Steering Committee elections and may stand for elected positions, subject to the eligibility requirements outlined in this Charter.
.. Manager: A Developer Relations Foundation Manager (“Manager”) is an individual appointed or recognized by the Steering Committee to lead or coordinate a specific initiative, working group, event, or other Foundation-sponsored activity. Managers are responsible for facilitating collaboration, reporting progress to the SC, and ensuring that their assigned efforts align with the mission and policies of the Developer Relations Foundation. Managers may be volunteers or nominated by the community, and their roles and responsibilities will be published in the relevant working group or project documentation. 
.. Maintainer: A Maintainer is a Contributor who has been granted ongoing responsibility for the quality and direction of a specific repository, documentation set, or project area within the Developer Relations Foundation. Maintainers review and approve contributions, ensure adherence to project standards, and help shape the technical or strategic roadmap for their domain. Maintainers are typically selected based on demonstrated leadership, subject matter expertise, and sustained contribution, and their role may be defined in more detail in the project’s CONTRIBUTING file.
. **Steering Committee** 
.. The Steering Committee (the “SC”) will be responsible for all oversight of the open collaboration Project.  
.. The SC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be set forth within the “CONTRIBUTING” file within the Project’s code repository. The SC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the SC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file.  Any meetings of the Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.  
.. SC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The SC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented:  
... Contributors include anyone in the community that contributes code, documentation, or other artifacts to the Project;  
... Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other artifacts in a project’s repository; and
... A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.
... A Collaborator is a participant of the community with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the SC. 
.. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.  
.. The SC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any SC roles,  as it sees fit. 
.. The SC may elect a SC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the SC and will serve until their resignation, term limit,  or replacement by the SC.**   
.. Responsibilities: The SC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include: 
... coordinating the direction of the Project; 
... approving working groups based on the evolving needs and priorities defined by the community;
... organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects; 
... defining roles and other positions and setting criteria and processes on how those roles and positions are filled; 
... creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project issues and requirements; 
... appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities; 
... establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;  
... approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be 
... published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager”) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;
