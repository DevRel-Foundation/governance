The Developer Relations Foundation outlines voting procedures and eligibility requirements in its [technical charter](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/Technical_Charter.adoc). During designated voting periods, detailed instructions and nomination forms will be shared through the Foundation’s standard communication channels, such as Discord and email.

Any current participant, manager, or maintainer, as defined in section 2 of [the charter](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/Technical_Charter.adoc), of the Developer Relations Foundation may nominate themselves or another eligible individual during the nomination period.

Before submitting a nomination, nominees should carefully review the responsibilities and eligibility criteria associated with the role. Additionally, nominators are encouraged to review the current [Steering Committee members](http://dev-rel.org/about/steering-committee), their backgrounds, areas of expertise, and geographic representations. This helps ensure that new nominees bring diverse perspectives and experiences, and can help fill gaps in regional representation, subject matter expertise, and lived experience.

**Eligibility Requirements**

1.  Must be a member of the Developer Relations Foundation for > 1 month prior to the start of the nomination process.
2.  Must have 5+ years of direct Developer Relations experience, or experience within an adjacent field.
3.  Must have demonstrable leadership experience within the Developer Relations field, such as:
    1.  Leading complex communities, programs, and/or teams.
    2.  Cultivating internal cross-functional relationships.
    3.  Developing open source frameworks and tools for the industry.

**Responsibilities** 

The primary Developer Relations Foundation Steering Committee responsibilities include:
*   Collecting input on priorities and encouraging community involvement to advance processes and frameworks. This includes forming and overseeing working groups to address specific areas of interest.
*   Leading and facilitating community calls across various time zones (AMER, EMEA, and APAC) to foster open discussions, share updates, and gather feedback from community and working group participants.
*   Overseeing project management and operational tasks such as public relations, website development, repo documentation and communications.

**Time Commitment and Expectations**

Steering Committee members are expected to dedicate a minimum of five hours per week to their role. This time commitment includes participation in weekly meetings, engagement in asynchronous communications, and completion of individual action items.

Members are expected to actively and proactively contribute to the Steering Committee, the Developer Relations Foundation (DRF), and its broader community. While it is recognized that Steering Committee members serve in a volunteer capacity and may have other professional and personal obligations, they should be prepared to allocate sufficient time to fulfill their responsibilities.

Occasional periods of reduced availability due to personal or professional reasons are understandable; however, these should be the exception rather than the norm. Individuals considering this role should carefully evaluate their ability to meet the time and engagement expectations before applying.
