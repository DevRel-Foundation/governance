## Tools and Resources for Working Group Managers

Effectively managing a working group within the DevRel Foundation requires access to the right tools and best practices. Below are key resources to help working group managers navigate governance structure, responsibilities, and operational guidelines.

### üìò Resources

- **[DevRel Foundation Overview](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/README.md)**: A high-level guide to understanding how the Developer Relations Foundation operates, its structure, and the roles, responsibilities, and influence of working groups within the DRF ecosystem. This guide also outlines the processes for community participants to contact Steering Committee Representatives or reach out to Linux Foundation staff when needed.
  
- **[Glossary of Terms](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/tree/main/glossary)**: Defines key terms used in the Developer Relations Foundation, including general roles, available tools from the Linux Foundation for community and project management, commonly used terminology, and communication tools available for the community.

### üìë Best Practices

Managing open collaborative projects without prior experience in open source principles can be overwhelming and challenging. It requires a cultural shift and an understanding of transparent governance, inclusive decision-making, and community-driven development.

Everyone has to take their first step into open source at some point. Learning about open source culture is an ongoing process, and anyone can gain knowledge and experience over time. Don‚Äôt be afraid of making mistakes‚Äîopenness and iteration are key aspects of the ecosystem. If you face difficulties, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to the DRF Steering Committee or Linux Foundation staff for guidance.

To help you navigate this effectively, here are a few best practices for your role as a WG manager.

- Follow the governance structure outlined in the [Governance README](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/README.md)
- Make use of the glossary words to ensure consistent terminology in discussions, charters, and goal creation
- Ensure your group maintains transparency by documenting progress and work on GitHub repo via, issues and Pull Requests
- Whenever possible, mirror announcements, updates, or key discussions not only on Discord, but also on the WG mailing list or GitHub Discussions (available in the governance repo)
- Encourage participation by establishing clear roles and responsibilities within the working group an document it in the WG Charter

### üìë Articles and Literature
